\#  Movie Recommendation System



A machine learning project that recommends movies to users based on their viewing history, using both \*\*collaborative filtering\*\* and \*\*matrix factorization\*\* techniques.  

Developed in a Jupyter Notebook as part of my Data Science \& AI portfolio.

\##  Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a movie recommender system from scratch, applying:

\- \*\*Item-based collaborative filtering\*\* using cosine similarity

\- \*\*Matrix factorization\*\* via Truncated SVD

\- Interactive recommendations with Jupyter widgets



The system can:

\- Suggest similar movies to any given title

\- Generate recommendations tailored to a specific user

\- Work with real datasets (like MovieLens) or synthetic data
